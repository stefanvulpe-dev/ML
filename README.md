# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. The algorithms are implemented in a way that they can be used for educational purposes and can be easily understood. The repository is divided into two main parts:

1. **Supervised Learning Algorithms**
2. **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**

Each part contains the implementation of various algorithms. The algorithms are implemented in the form of classes and functions. The classes contain the implementation of the algorithms and the functions contain the implementation of the helper functions that are used in the algorithms. The repository also contains the implementation of various evaluation metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
